# CO2_Upscaling
R code to:

1. Run a weigthed random-forest (meta-forest) model selection analysis to identify the best descriptors of the CO2 fertilization effect in the dataset.
2. Design a regression model to predict CO2 effects in the dataset.
3. Upscale CO2 effects globally
4. Compare results with independent approaches
5. Zonal statistics for tabuled results
6. Plot resulting maps (Fig. 2)

Full details of the implemented methods are available in Terrer et al. 2019
